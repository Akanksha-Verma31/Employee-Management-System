# MEAN Stack Sample Application
## Employee-Management-System
This is a simple CRUD application built using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack.
In this tutorial, we have build a RESTful API that implements the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for an employee. For data persistence, we'll be using a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

We'll be building an employee management web application. The interface will have the following pages:

- View all employees
- Add new employees
- Update existing employees

Here's what the finished application looks like:
